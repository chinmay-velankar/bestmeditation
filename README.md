<h3>SOME USEFUL INFO ABOUT MEDITATION</h3>
<p>Introduction
Mantra meditation* has been practiced in India for thousands of years because people knew that it reduces stress, calms the mind and increases inner peace. In the 1970s medical researchers at Harvard University began studying a form of meditation from India called Transcendental Meditation®. They found that during the practice of meditation the body has what they call the relaxation response, which gives the body deep rest that is deeper than the rest from sleep. They also found that through regular meditation that deep rest builds up in the body over time, and it is that deepening reservoir of rest that reduces stress and results in the many benefits of meditation.

Stress accounts for over 60% of doctor visits. So building on their studies, Harvard researchers then developed a form of mantra meditation that easily elicits the relaxation response and started teaching that meditation to doctors through Harvard Medical School. Inner Peace Meditation is based in part on that meditation developed at Harvard and in part on decades of mantra meditation practice by the staff of InnerPeaceFellowship.org.

Harvard researchers and others continued to study meditation and found that it can lower blood pressure, cholesterol and the risk of heart disease and stroke, can help relieve stress, depression, insomnia, sleeplessness, anxiety and worry, and can increase productivity, learning, happiness, well-being and inner peace. And people report having more mindfulness and deeper transcendence from Inner Peace Meditation and that it’s easy to learn. </p>
